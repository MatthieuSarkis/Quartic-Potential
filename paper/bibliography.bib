  abstract = { We find that the analytical solutions to quantum system with a quartic potential V (x) = ax2 + bx4 (arbitrary a and b > 0 are real numbers) are given by the triconfluent Heun functions HT(α,β,γ; z). The properties of the wave functions, which are strongly relevant for the potential parameters a and b, are illustrated. It is shown that the wave functions are shrunk to the origin for a given b when the potential parameter a increases, while the wave peak of wave functions is concaved to the origin when the negative potential parameter |a| increases or parameter b decreases for a given negative potential parameter a. The minimum value of the double well case (a < 0) is given by Vmin = −a2/(4b) at x = ±|a|/2b. }

The result has shown that Morse potential is shape invariance. A method identifying the Morse potential according to the energy spectrum of diatomic molecule has been suggested. Moreover, we also give the comprehension to shape invariance from space symmetry.}

  abstract  = {We present a numerical approach to the central two-point connection problem for the confluent cases of the Heun class of differential equations. The crucial step is an ansatz for the solutions of the equations in terms of a generalized power series (called Jaffé expansions). It is shown that the resulting difference equations for the coefficients of these series are of Poincaré-Perron type. A (formal) asymptotic investigation of the solutions of these difference equations yields the exact eigenvalue condition.}
